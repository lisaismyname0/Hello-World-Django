SETTING UP A NEW PROJECT IN DJANGO

$python3 -m venv .venv
$source .venv/bin/activate
$pipenv install django
    - this creates pipfile and pipfile.lock
$django-admin startproject core .
    - here core is a name of the directory we are creating
    - this also creates the core directory (which contains urls.py and settings.py) and and manage.py file
$code .
    - opens files in text editor
$python3 manage.py startapp classes
    - this creates another directory(aka app or project) in our directory that contains other important file templates like models.py, views.py etc

after this we made a User model in models.py and then went into settings.py and added AUTH_USER_MODEL

now we are setting up a database 
    - SQL lite is an option for building a database
we added our classes app (directory) to list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py then
$python3 manage.py makemigrations
    - shows that we made the model User
    -(python3 manage.py showmigrations will show you all of the moving parts)
    -migrations are instructions that are to be created on how to update the database. they are not applied until we:
$python3 manage.py migrate

from here we update our models.py to include our "Flavor" model
- which is the template for how our class Flavor items will be displayed
then makemigrations & migrate

We add our User & Flavor models to admin.py
    - in between here is where we added the class Meta
    - we also incorporated a string method in our model

now we add a new model relationship:
    - we made the class Season and use a foreign key to link it to our class Flavor 

    from there we went into the django admin and added some seasons
    
    we also added a string method to make our seasons have the same name their content

now we incorporate the django template language
